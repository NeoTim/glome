**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This module contains a Java implementation for the GLOME
protocol.

## Usage

Let's say Alice and Bob want to establish a communication. Then both parties
should know their peer's public key. This is an example of how Alice can use 
the Glome object to generate a tag:

```Java
import com.google.jglome.Glome;
import com.google.jglome.Glome.GlomeBuilder;

public class Main {

  public void sendMsgToBob() {
    // Generates a Glome object for Alice with Bob's public key `BobPublicKey` 
    // and minimum length of Bob's tag - 32.
    Glome AliceManager = new GlomeBuilder(BobPublicKey, 32).build();

    // Generates a tag with `msg` message. Considering that this message 
    // is first to be sent to Bob from Alice, the counter is set to 0.
    byte[] tag = AliceManager.generateTag(msg, 0);
    
    // Post-processing code block.
  }

}
```

Then Alice should send Bob both `msg`, `tag` and Alice's public key.
As soon as Bob receives them he will need to do the following:

```Java
import com.google.jglome.Glome;
import com.google.jglome.Glome.GlomeBuilder;
import com.google.jglome.Glome.WrongTagException;

public class Main {

  public void sendMsgToBob() {
    // Generates a Glome object for Bob with Alice's public key `AlicePublicKey` 
    // and minimum length of Alice's tag - 32.
    Glome BobManager = new GlomeBuilder(AlicePublicKey, 32).build();

    // Checks if the received tag `tag` matches the received message `msg` and
    // a number of messages which have been sent from Alice to Bob - 0.
    try {
      BobManager.checkTag(tag, msg, 0);
    } catch (WrongTagException e) {
      // Handle the exception.
    }
    
    // Post-processing code block.
  }

}
```

Look at the source code for more details.

## Keys

The library maintains both usage of preexisting keys and key generation. If you
want to use a special key pair you may create a Glome object in the following way:

```Java
import com.google.jglome.Glome;
import com.google.jglome.Glome.GlomeBuilder;

public class Main {

  public void GlomeFromKeys() {
    // Generates a Glome object for Bob with Alice's public key `AlicePublicKey` 
    // and minimum length of Alice's tag `32`.
    Glome BobManager = new GlomeBuilder(AlicePublicKey, 32)
      .setPrivateKey(BobPrivateKey)
      .build();
    
    // Post-processing code block.
  }

}
```

If you the keys to be generated by Glome object, you may create like in the way
which is written in the above section.
